CSC 439: Introduction to Compiler Design

Fall 2020

The "src" folder in this directory contains the Java source code for the Compiler Project. This project was divided into four main phases: lexical analysis, parsing, intermediate code generation, and machine/assembly code generation.

This compiler translates source code for a simplified version of the C programming language (called "Little C") into MIPS Assembly Code. The compiler accepts Little C source code as input in the terminal of an IDE and outputs the MIPS code. The parsing tool ANTLR was used for the lexical analysis and parsing phases of the project.
